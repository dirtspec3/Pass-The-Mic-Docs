  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, <code>@dirt-spec</code> shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Service.</p>

  <h2>9. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate the Service, or your access to it, at any time without notice if you violate these Terms.</p>
